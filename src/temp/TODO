                    #Git rid of saving the full html to the mysql database (400+ MB of data being saved)

#Change using a stored procedure to add threads to doing a REPLACE

                    #condense fields being saved to database
                            --no need for socketed items...
                            --lookups for explicit mods (3rd table)

#separate out saving to database and getting each thread's info to better update the jtable
--redo sockets datatype... redundant dashes used
--explicit/implicit mods in another single table.. use a boolean to specify implicit w/ default being explicit
**be careful at the join order... make sure the joins go from smallest table (list of types of mods
**to biggest table
--create indexed table for icons (make sure to include parsing to minimize file size)

#try using batch prepared statements again
--http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1915166/how-to-get-the-insert-id-in-jdbc
**ThreadID is not needed since that is based on the webpage
--ItemID on the database is gotten from retreiving the identity... will 
--  have to redesign database to use multiple tables

                    #create mysqldump's of the tables
                        --find size after zipping... maybe create downloadable datasets?

#Git rid of saving the full html to the mysql database (400+ MB of data being saved)

#condense fields being saved to database
         --no need for socketed items...
         --lookups for explicit mods (3rd table)

#create mysqldump's of the tables
        --find size after zipping... maybe create downloadable datasets?
